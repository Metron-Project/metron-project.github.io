# April 2024 News

## Monthly Statistics

During March and April the [Metron Project](https://metron.cloud/) added the following to its database:

- Users: **75**
- Issues: **4,495**
- Creators: **255**
- Characters: **1,632**

Thanks to everyone that contributed!

## Digital Chapters

Recently a new series type, *Digital Chapters*, was added to Metron. This was to facilitate adding digital comics, like
**[DC Comics Bombshells](https://metron.cloud/series/dc-comics-bombshells-2015/)**. This series type appends the
word `Digital` to the series display name and adds `Chapter` to
the [issue display name](https://metron.cloud/issue/batman-beyond-2012-1/). When adding *Digital Chapters* series, the
print version should ***not*** be added as an associated seres, but added as reprints to the appropriate issues. For an
example of this, please refer to this [issue](https://metron.cloud/issue/batman-the-adventures-continue-2020-1-1/).

Anyway, that's all I've got for this month. Take Care!
