Did a quick release today of [Darkseid](https://github.com/Metron-Project/darkseid) that fixes a bug which prevented exporting rar (.cbr) comics to zip files (.cbz). If you use [Metron-Tagger](https://github.com/Metron-Project/metron-tagger) and export rar files, it would be worthwhile to update Darkseid which can be done with the following command:

```
pip3 install -U --user darkseid
```
