## New Indexed Issues Milestone

The [Metron Project](https://metron.cloud/) reached a milestone today by having 65,000 issues added to its database. I wish to give big thanks to everyone who has helped with the project. Thanks!

## POST API

Been spending the last few months working on a POST API to make it easier to add/update information on Metron. Currently it's only available to users with Adminstrators permissions, but later this year I'll look at the feasability of making it more readily available.

## Comic Vine ID's

Another project I've been working on is adding [Comic Vine](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/) identification numbers to the various resource items. This should help users match items between the two data sources. Currently, about 40% of the issues have been updated with this information and with any luck the majority of issues will be finished by the end of the month.

## ComicTagger

One of the developers of [Comic Tagger](https://github.com/comictagger/comictagger) has been working on adding support for tagging digital comics with data from Metron, and hopefully in the next couple of months that merged.
