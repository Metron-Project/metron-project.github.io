Thanks to everyone that contributed!

# Final Order Cutoff (FOC) Dates

With [Diamond announcing they will stop printing their Previews](https://www.comicsbeat.com/diamond-announces-print-previews-to-end/), I had some comic industry people contact me about adding the Final Order Cutoff (FOC) dates to upcoming issue releases. With that information, users could use our API to create their pull lists. This was a fairly simple request, which won't affect most users (since my tools that import upcoming releases will handle it) and was [added](https://github.com/Metron-Project/metron/pull/354) to the site on June 17th.

# Darkseid / Metron-Tagger Release

TODO

## OpenCollective

If you would like to help the project, we have an account at [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/metron) to
defray the servers costs and help with increasing future server capacity.

Anyway, that's all I got for this month. Take care!
