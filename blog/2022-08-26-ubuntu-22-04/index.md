Finally got around to upgrading the OS for Metron to [Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS](https://releases.ubuntu.com/22.04.1/), which overall, was fairly painless. Tests didn't find anything obviously broken, but if you do run across something that is, please open a [bug](https://github.com/bpepple/metron/issues/new/choose) for it. Thx!
