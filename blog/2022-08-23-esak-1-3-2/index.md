Did a quick release this morning of the python wrapper for the Marvel API, [Esak](https://github.com/Metron-Project/esak), which adds an option to have the cache results expire after a user-defined number of days. To update to the latest version just run the following command:

```
pip3 install -U --user darkseid
```
