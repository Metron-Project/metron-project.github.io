# July 2025 News

## Monthly Statistics

During June the [Metron Project](https://metron.cloud/) added the following to its database:

- Users: **48**
- Issues: **1,102**
- Creators: **91**
- Characters: **407**

Thanks to everyone that contributed!

## Bulma CSS

The site has been updated to the latest version of [Bulma CSS](https://bulma.io/), so it now 
follows you computer's theme (light/dark). There's a few widgets that still need to be fixed to 
work well with the dark theme, primarily the autocomplete fields in some of the forms (Issue, 
Series. etc.), but that work _really_ needs to be done upstream.

The upside of being on the most recent version of Bulma is that I can start working on adding a 
better system for [documentation](../2025-06-01-april-may-update/index.md#documentation) to the site.

## MetronInfo.xml

[AJ](https://github.com/ajslater) recently released new versions of 
[ComicBox](https://github.com/ajslater/comicbox) and [Codex](https://github.com/ajslater/codex) 
that added support for [MetronInfo XML](https://github.com/Metron-Project/metroninfo).

If you're looking for a list of software that supports this relatively new format you can find a 
list of software 
[here](https://github.com/Metron-Project/metroninfo?tab=readme-ov-file#what-software-currently-supports-it).

## OpenCollective

If you would like to help keep the lights on at the project, we have an account at
[Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/metron) to defray the servers costs and help with increasing future
server capacity.

Anyway, that's all I got for this month. Take care!
