# October 2024 News

Ok, been fairly busy the last couple of months so naturally blogging has taken a back-burner. So, here's a summary of
what's been going on the last few months.

## Monthly Statistics

During August the [Metron Project](https://metron.cloud/) added the following to its database:

- Users: **41**
- Issues: **1,377**
- Creators: **147**
- Characters: **346**

During September the following was added:

- Users: **100**
- Issues: **1,330**
- Creators: **124**
- Characters: **379**

During October the following was added:

- Users: **51**
- Issues: **1,996**
- Creators: **122**
- Characters: **740**

## Comic Vine Outage

[Comic Vine](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/) went down at the end of September for about 6 days, so we saw an influx of
new users which necessitated in increasing our server's capacity. One thing this episode brought to light out was the
need for the project to accept donations for future infrastructure costs (since I'm currently covering the server
costs).

To help us set this up it would be greatly appreciated if you could star
the [repository](https://github.com/Metron-Project/metron) since one of the requirements to set up an account
on [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/) is to have 100 stars.

## Server OS Upgrade

I had planned to upgrade the server in August, but y'know... life. Anyway, I'm tentatively planning to upgrade Metron's
operating system on November 16th, so there might be some downtime (most likely a few hours) when I do that. I'll post a
notification on the site for the week leading to the upgrade.

## MetronInfo.xml

The last couple of months there has been a bunch of work done on finalizing
the [MetronInfo.xsd](https://github.com/Metron-Project/metroninfo)
by [Joe](https://github.com/majora2007), [AJ](https://github.com/ajslater), [Buried-In-Code](https://github.com/Buried-In-Code)
and myself, and I believe there are just a couple of
outstanding [items](https://github.com/Metron-Project/metroninfo/issues/38) that need a resolution. Once that is done,
I'll write up a announcement blog post.

Anyway, that's all I've got for this month. Take care!
