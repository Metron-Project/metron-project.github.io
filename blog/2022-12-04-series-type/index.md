Made a minor change to the ***series types*** available by consolidating ***mini & maxi-series*** to the new ***Limited Series*** type. There isn't a real definite value for mini and maxi series, and really it makes more sense to not bother differentiating them. So, I've gone ahead and migrated the existing data for this change, and users should see this change. If you have any questions or thoughts, don't hesitate to contact [me](mailto:bpepple@metron.cloud).
