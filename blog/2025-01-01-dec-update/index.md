## Grand Comics Database (GCD) ID Support

Recently support for [GCD](https://www.comics.org/) ID's was added to the site, and we've currently linked about 50% of
the issues on the [site](https://metron.cloud/), and with luck, should be completed in the next week or so.

## Potential January Projects

I'm looking at some small projects to work on in January, and some potential ones I'm thinking about are:

- Add Legacy Numbering field
- Alternative Series Name field
- Advanced Resources (Series, Issues, etc) Search
- [Resource ID URLS](https://github.com/Metron-Project/metron/issues/180)

Not sure which ones (or any) will be implemented, but I'm planning to dig into them a bit more in the next few weeks.

## OpenCollective

We've recently set up an account at [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/) if you wish to help defray the server
costs and help with increasing future server capacity.

Anyway, that's all I got for now, hope everyone had a great holiday and are enjoying New Years day. Take Care!
