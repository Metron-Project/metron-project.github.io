This will allow other folks to\\nhandle [requests](https://github.com/Metron-Project/metron/discussions/306) to add series to Metron. With luck, I should\\nfinish next month, and I\'ll start looking at what users to promote.\\n\\n## Comic Book Reading Lists\\n\\nRecently, I\'ve been looking at Comic Book Reading Lists since\\na [bug report](https://github.com/Metron-Project/metron/issues/302) was opened to add support for generating them.\\nCurrently, users use [CBL\'s](https://github.com/DieselTech/CBL-ReadingLists) that are imported into their comic server\\nof choice ([Kavita](https://www.kavitareader.com/), [Codex](https://github.com/ajslater/codex), etc.), which seems\\nnon-optimal primarily since, in essence, it\'s another database of information. Now, this makes sense, since for a long\\ntime the only source of usable data via an API was [Comic Vine](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/), which hasn\'t had a\\ndeveloper presence in _years_, and having a new feature added to their site is __extremely__ unlikely.\\n\\nI think a better solution would be for the other databases that offer an API ([GCD](https://www.comics.org/api/) &\\nMetron) to have the option for users to create reading lists (similar to [MovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)) and\\nhave that data available either by generating a file or through an API call. Now, to do this we would need to work with\\nthe comic server developers to determine exactly what data they would need, though it would probably look similar to\\nthis:\\n\\n```shell\\n{\\n  \\"arc\\": {\\n    \\"name\\": \\"Foo Bar Wars\\"\\n  }\\n  \\"issues\\": {\\n    \\"issue\\": {\\n      \\"id\\": {\\n      \\"cv_id\\": 9999\\n      \\"metron\\": 5678\\n      \\"gcd\\": 9856\\n      }\\n      \\"index\\": 0\\n    }\\n    \\"issue\\": {\\n      \\"id\\": {\\n      \\"cv_id\\": 12345\\n      \\"metron\\": 9999\\n      \\"gcd\\": 123\\n      }\\n      \\"index\\": 1\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe current standard (CBL) and the recent [json-cbl-standard](https://github.com/ComicReadingLists/json-cbl-standard)\\ncontains a look of information that I can\'t see a comic server needing, primarily all the series-level info which the\\ncomic servers should already have in their databases. Of course, I\'d love to hear from any developer in this space to\\nverify that.\\n\\nOnce the basic functionality was added, importing any existing CBL into GCD or Metron should be fairly trivial, since\\nMetron links other sites issue id\'s (GCD would be able to use Metron\'s API to link since they don\'t track this\\ninformation).\\n\\nAnyway, those are some of my quick thoughts on what the future of Comic Book Reading Lists could look like, and if\\nanyone has interest in working on this potential future project, contact me\\non [GitHub](https://github.com/Metron-Project/metron)\\nor [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#metron-general:matrix.org).\\n\\n## Rate Limiting\\n\\nOne thing I\'ve been debating is whether to modify our Rate Limiting policy. The primary reason for this is there are a\\n_lot_ of user that hammer the API for 24+ hours straight for days on end, and I\'m contemplating _adding_ a total\\nnumber of API hits per day (maybe something like 10,000) in _addition_ to the 30/hour to ease the server load.\\n\\nNow doing this will make it a bit harder implement to write software for the API since the developer will need to track\\nthe API rate between sessions, but there are libraries\\nlike [pyrate-limiter](https://pyratelimiter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which use a SQLite or Redis backend to make\\nthis easier to implement.\\n\\nAnyway, this is something I\'m just mulling over and if you want to weigh-in you can\\non [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#metron-general:matrix.org) or in\\na [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/Metron-Project/metron/discussions).\\n\\n## OpenCollective\\n\\nWe\'ve recently set up an account at [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/metron) if you wish to help defray the\\nserver costs and help with increasing future server capacity. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\\n\\nAnyway, that\'s all I got for this month.

So, I\'ll start off by answering some\\nquestions (most of this will be from the projects README).\\n\\n## What is it?\\n\\nMetronInfo is a *new* xml document type that fixes some deficiencies that exist in the current de facto xml\\nfile, [ComicInfo.xml](https://github.com/anansi-project/comicinfo), to store metadata for a comic. Some of our\\nimprovements include:\\n\\n- Addition elements to track information that are not included with the current standard.\\n- Better handling of data types. For instance, instead of using delimited strings we use arrays of elements.\\n- Elements to track where the data was obtained from.\\n- `id` attributes for resources (Characters, Creators, etc.), so items with different names can be associated correctly.\\n\\n## Is the schema only for the Metron Database?\\n\\nNo, the schema only has *Metron* in the name since almost every other format has *Comic* in the name, and the\\noriginating author hates naming projects, so he went with the simplest choice. \ud83d\ude04 It was designed to be used for any of\\nthe comic resources (Comic Vine, AniList, etc.)\\n\\n## Where can I find the schemas?\\n\\nVersion 1.0 of the schema is located in [schema](https://github.com/Metron-Project/metroninfo/tree/master/schema)\\ndirectory\\n\\n## Is there documentation for it?\\n\\nYes, there is [documentation](https://metron-project.github.io/docs/category/metroninfo) describing the elements usage\\nand also a Matrix to help with age rating mapping.\\n\\n## How can I validate my XML?\\n\\nIt\'s recommended that any software that writes the XML make use of the schema to validate, so consumers of the XML\\ndocument can be sure of its data. The schema use XSD 1.1, so you need to make sure your validation code uses that\\ninstead of XSD 1.0.\\n\\nFor example to validate the XML in python:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom pathlib import Path\\nfrom xmlschema import XMLSchema11, XMLSchemaValidationError\\n\\nxsd = Path(\\"/home/user/MetronInfo.xsd\\")\\nxml = Path(\\"/home/user/MetronInfo.xml\\")\\n\\nschema = XMLSchema11(xsd)\\ntry:\\n    schema.validate(xml)\\nexcept XMLSchemaValidationError as e:\\n    print(f\\"Failed to validate XML: {e!r}\\")\\n    exit(1)\\n\\n# Code to write / read the xml file\\n```\\n\\n## What software currently supports it?\\n\\nCurrently, the following software does:\\n\\n- [Metron-Tagger](https://github.com/Metron-Project/metron-tagger) - Commandline tool to tag comic with metadata (\\n  MetronInfo or ComicInfo) from Metron Comic Book Database.\\n\\nIf you are a developer that has added support for MetronInfo.xml to your software, please create a PR to update the\\nREADME\\nor [contact me](mailto:bpepple@metron.cloud?subject=MetronInfo%20Support&body=Please%20add%20the%20following%20software%20to%the%20README:%20).\\n\\n## Future\\n\\nOne of the goals of the project was to be responsive to the needs of the community, so if you have suggestion for\\nimprovements to the schema please file a\\n[feature request](https://github.com/Metron-Project/metroninfo/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=feature_request.md&title=),\\n[bug report](https://github.com/Metron-Project/metroninfo/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=bug_report.md&title=),\\nor start a [discussion](https://github.com/Metron-Project/metroninfo/discussions).\\n\\n## Thanks\\n\\nI\'d like to thank everyone that has contributed to the schema, and in\\nparticular [AJ](https://github.com/ajslater), [Buried-In-Code](https://github.com/Buried-In-Code),\\nand [Joe](https://github.com/majora2007) who have helped out a lot in the last few months."},{"id":"october-2024-update","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/october-2024-update","source":"@site/blog/2024-11-02-oct-update/index.md","title":"October 2024 Update","description":"Ok, been fairly busy the last couple of months so naturally blogging has taken a back-burner.

For example, `Action Comics v1 #2`.\\n* __Trade Paperback__: This is the most common kind of collected edition where it is usually collecting 6-12 single issues.\\n\\n__Note__: Series Types descriptions are from this excellent article at [How to Love Comics](https://www.howtolovecomics.com/comic-book-glossary-of-terms/) \\n\\nIn addition to those changes, we\'ve added a new database field `status` to the `Series` model to track a series\' status. The values for this field are as follows:\\n* __Cancelled__: Used when a _Single Issue_ or _Annual_ series is ended. Sometimes can be used when a _Limited_ series is abandoned before completing its story.\\n* __Complete__: Commonly used when a _Limited_, _One-Shot_, _Graphic Novel_, _Hardcover_, _Omnibus_, or _Digital Chapters_ series is ended.\\n* __Hiatus__: When a series stops publishing before ending with the expectation that it will be finished at a later date.\\n* __Ongoing__: Used with the _Single Issue_ or _Annual_ series while it is still being published.\\n\\nTo help users update their existing comics with the new values without having to use Metron\'s API to re-tag their comics, I\'ve written [Karkas](https://github.com/bpepple/karkas) which will change the _Format_ element of a comics `ComicInfo.xml` to __Single Issue__ if they are currently __Cancelled__ or __Ongoing__, and __Annual__ if the value is __Annual Series__.

Some of the changes are as follows:\\n\\n- comicfn2dict\\n\\n  So, I switched over to using `comicfn2dict` for filename parsing, and did some testing on around 1,000 or so comics.\\n  Overall, it\'s performed as well as the old code and has the added benefit of being used by multiple projects.\\n\\n- Improved Matching\\n\\n  Spent some time improving comic matching by implementing the following changes:\\n\\n    - Only use the series name and issue number when querying Metron. By doing this we are likely to get a result from\\n      Metron. Also, we are striping out any special characters (like `,`, `-`, or `&`) from the series name.\\n    - Use the `cover hash` from Metron to verify the issue is correct, otherwise we\'ll ask the user for help.\\n    - Use existing `ComicInfo.xml` for matching. If a comic has already been tagged by comictagger (or Metron-Tagger)\\n      and has information to help identify the issue (like the [Comic Vine](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/) ID), we\'ll\\n      use that before using the filename.\\n\\n## Miscellaneous\\n\\nRight now, I\'m thinking about making some changes to the API (like adding versioning), and if I do I\'ll ask the\\ncommunity for any suggestions of changes they\'d like to see."},{"id":"january-2024-update","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/january-2024-update","source":"@site/blog/2024-02-01/index.md","title":"January 2024 Update","description":"Issues Indexed","date":"2024-02-01T09:12:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"comic","permalink":"/blog/tags/comic"},{"label":"database","permalink":"/blog/tags/database"},{"label":"metron","permalink":"/blog/tags/metron"},{"label":"metrontagger","permalink":"/blog/tags/metrontagger"},{"label":"multiverses","permalink":"/blog/tags/multiverses"},{"label":"universes","permalink":"/blog/tags/universes"}],"readingTime":0.995,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Brian Pepple","title":"Founder of the Metron Project / Code Monkey","url":"https://github.com/bpepple","imageURL":"https://github.com/bpepple.png","key":"bpepple"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"january-2024-update","title":"January 2024 Update","date":"2024-02-01T09:12","authors":["bpepple"],"tags":["comic","database","metron","metrontagger","multiverses","universes"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"February 2024 Update","permalink":"/blog/february-2024-update"},"nextItem":{"title":"December 2023 Update","permalink":"/blog/december-2023-update"}},"content":"## Issues Indexed\\n\\nThe [Metron Project](https://metron.cloud/) had a total of **7,816** issues added to its database during January bring\\nthe total number of issues to **106,500**.

Here\'s a partial list:\\n\\n- Upgrade Server\\n\\n  Currently, the server is fairly underpowered (1 GiB Memory, 1 CPU, 25 GiB SSD, 1,000 GiB Transfer) but is able to\\n  handle the current load without any particular issues. Based on the current user growth rate, I\'m guessing I\'ll\\n  finally need to upgrade sometime in 2024, I\'m thinking a fairly minor bump should be sufficient (2 GiB Memory,\\n  1CPU, 50 GiB SSD, 2,000 GiB Transfer)\\n\\n- Container Deployment\\n\\n  Before upgrading the server it makes sense to *finally* set up the project to use containers (preferably\\n  [Podman](https://podman.io/)) when deploying the website. If anyone wants to help\\n  with [this](https://github.com/bpepple/metron/issues/69), that would be awesome.\\n\\n- Look into Open Collective for Future Funding\\n\\n  Eventually it will make sense to look at setting up something like\\n  [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/opensource) to help with future server costs. Right now the server costs\\n  around $14 a month (not including annual domain name & email hosting costs) so it\'s not really an issue, but down the\\n  road I probably won\'t want to cover all the costs of the project myself.\\n\\n  Glancing at the criteria needed for acceptance to the Open Source Collective, it looks like Metron meets most of them,\\n  except having *100 stars* on [Github](https://github.com/). ***So, if you\'d like to help the project, one easy\\n  way would be to star the [repository](https://github.com/bpepple/metron).***\\n\\n- Manga / International Support\\n\\n  It would be nice to make a final decision on whether to support Manga and Non-U.S. issues, right now I\'m inclined not\\n  to but *if* we do add support it will necessitate some changes to the database for things like currencies, languages,\\n  and such.\\n\\nI\'m sure there will be other smaller items (like tweaking the site\'s css and such), but these are most items I\'ll be\\nlooking at in 2024. \ud83c\udf89"},{"id":"october-2023-update","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/october-2023-update","source":"@site/blog/2023-10-29-october-update/index.md","title":"October 2023 Update","description":"New Indexed Issues Milestone","date":"2023-10-29T10:04:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"comic","permalink":"/blog/tags/comic"},{"label":"database","permalink":"/blog/tags/database"},{"label":"metron","permalink":"/blog/tags/metron"},{"label":"metrontagger","permalink":"/blog/tags/metrontagger"},{"label":"comictagger","permalink":"/blog/tags/comictagger"}],"readingTime":1.6,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Brian Pepple","title":"Founder of the Metron Project / Code Monkey","url":"https://github.com/bpepple","imageURL":"https://github.com/bpepple.png","key":"bpepple"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"october-2023-update","title":"October 2023 Update","date":"2023-10-29T10:04","authors":["bpepple"],"tags":["comic","database","metron","metrontagger","comictagger"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"November 2023 Update","permalink":"/blog/november-2023-update"},"nextItem":{"title":"Latest Happenings","permalink":"/blog/latest-happenings"}},"content":"## New Indexed Issues Milestone\\n\\nThe [Metron Project](https://metron.cloud/) reached a milestone this month by having more than 77,000 issues added to\\nits database.

The feature will get the hashes for\\nall the pages of the comics in a directory, and then ask the user if the image should be removed from the comics. This\\nis done by using the user\'s system image viewer to display the duplicate image. Once the user has reviewed all the\\nduplicated images it will ask the user whether to write the changes to the comics and then prompt them if they also want\\nto update the [ComicInfo.xml](https://anansi-project.github.io/docs/comicinfo/intro) (if it exists) for the page\\nchanges.\\n\\nThis feature most likely will work best when running on a weekly basis, instead of on a ***whole*** comic collection,\\nsince it\'s asking the user to review all the duplicate images *before* writing the changes. I\'m planning on reworking\\nthis to make it more feasible to use on a large comic collection, but that is pretty far down on my TODO list (but if\\nsomeone wants to work on this I\'m more than willing to review a Pull Request).\\n\\n**Note**: I\'ve been using this for the last month and haven\'t had any issues, but if you plan on using this I would\\nsuggest backing up any files when using this initially, and verifying it works correctly for you since once the changes\\nare written they can\'t be undone! \ud83d\udca3\\n\\n### Miscellaneous Maintenance\\n\\nThe rest of v1.6.4 changes are primarily developer-side changes updating the toolsets for Metron-Tagger.\\n\\n## Comic-Tagger\\n\\n[Comic-Tagger](https://github.com/comictagger/comictagger) recently released\\ntheir [Metron-Talker](https://github.com/comictagger/metron_talker) plugin which adds support for tagging any comic with\\nmetadata from [Metron](https://metron.cloud/)."},{"id":"latest-happenings","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/latest-happenings","source":"@site/blog/2023-05-23-latest-happenings/index.md","title":"Latest Happenings","description":"New Indexed Issues Milestone","date":"2023-05-24T13:24:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"comic","permalink":"/blog/tags/comic"},{"label":"database","permalink":"/blog/tags/database"},{"label":"series","permalink":"/blog/tags/series"},{"label":"api","permalink":"/blog/tags/api"},{"label":"comicvine","permalink":"/blog/tags/comicvine"},{"label":"comictagger","permalink":"/blog/tags/comictagger"}],"readingTime":0.88,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Brian Pepple","title":"Founder of the Metron Project / Code Monkey","url":"https://github.com/bpepple","imageURL":"https://github.com/bpepple.png","key":"bpepple"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"latest-happenings","title":"Latest Happenings","date":"2023-05-24T13:24","authors":["bpepple"],"tags":["comic","database","series","api","comicvine","comictagger"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"October 2023 Update","permalink":"/blog/october-2023-update"},"nextItem":{"title":"Limited Series Type","permalink":"/blog/series-type-change"}},"content":"## New Indexed Issues Milestone\\n\\nThe [Metron Project](https://metron.cloud/) reached a milestone today by having 65,000 issues added to its database.

Anyway, let\'s get started!\\n\\nFirst off, you\'ll want to download the most recent database dump from GCD which can be found [here](https://www.comics.org/download/). Once it\'s finished downloading, unzip the file:\\n\\n```\\nunzip current.zip -d /tmp/\\n```\\nYou should see output similar to this:\\n\\n```\\nArchive:  current.zip\\n  inflating: /tmp/2022-10-01.sql   \\n```\\n\\nOk, now that we\'ve got the data from gcd, let\'s create a [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) container. We need to first pull a MySQL image, which can be done by running:\\n\\n```\\npodman pull docker.io/library/mysql:5.7\\n```\\n\\nAfter it\'s done downloading the image, you can confirm:\\n\\n```\\npodman images\\n```\\n\\nwhich should return output similar to this:\\n\\n```\\nbpepple@frodo ~ $ podman images mysql\\nREPOSITORY               TAG         IMAGE ID      CREATED       SIZE\\ndocker.io/library/mysql  5.7         eb175b0743cc  19 hours ago  448 MB\\n```\\n\\nNow we need to create the container. You\'ll want to replace user and mysql credentials with your own values. The `volume` flag is where on your filesystem you want to save the database. The `Z` suffix is used for systems, primarily [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/linux/what-is-selinux)-based, that use [SELinux](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/linux/what-is-selinux). If you don\'t use SELinux that can be dropped:\\n\\n```\\npodman run -d --name mysql -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_USER=bpepple -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=123456 -e MYSQL_DATABASE=gcd -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=567890 --volume /home/bpepple/Storage/pods/mysql/:/var/lib/mysql:Z mysql:5.7\\n```\\n\\nNow let\'s verify that the container was created and is running by using the following:\\n\\n```\\npodman ps\\n```\\n\\nYou should see output similar to this:\\n\\n```\\nbpepple@frodo ~ $ podman ps\\nCONTAINER ID  IMAGE                       COMMAND CREATED       STATUS           PORTS                  NAMES\\n400c957ae25d  docker.io/library/mysql:5.7 mysqld  7 seconds ago Up 7 seconds ago 0.0.0.0:3306->3306/tcp mysql\\n```\\nNow we just need to dump the data from GCD into the database. We can do this by running:\\n\\n```\\ncat /tmp/2022-10-01.sql | podman exec -i mysql /usr/bin/mysql -u root --password=567890 gcd\\n```\\nDepending on the specs of your machine, this might be a good time to grab some coffee, since the SQL dump is **very** large and will take awhile to finish. Once it\'s done, we can start using the database by attaching to the container:\\n\\n```\\npodman exec -it mysql mysql -ubpepple -p gcd\\n```\\n\\nThis command will prompt you for your password, and then you\'ll see the MySQL prompt where you can run a simple SQL statement like so:\\n```\\n DESCRIBE gcd_issue;\\n```\\nWhich should produce output similar to this:\\n```\\n+----------------------------+---------------+------+-----+---------------------+----------------+\\n| Field                      | Type          | Null | Key | Default             | Extra          |\\n+----------------------------+---------------+------+-----+---------------------+----------------+\\n| id                         | int(11)       | NO   | PRI | NULL                | auto_increment |\\n| number                     | varchar(50)   | NO   | MUL | NULL                |                |\\n| volume                     | varchar(50)   | NO   | MUL |                     |                |\\n| no_volume                  | tinyint(1)    | NO   | MUL | 0                   |                |\\n| display_volume_with_number | tinyint(1)    | NO   | MUL | 0                   |                |\\n| series_id                  | int(11)       | NO   | MUL | NULL                |                |\\n| indicia_publisher_id       | int(11)       | YES  | MUL | NULL                |                |\\n| indicia_pub_not_printed    | tinyint(1)    | NO   |     | NULL                |                |\\n| brand_id                   | int(11)       | YES  | MUL | NULL                |                |\\n| no_brand                   | tinyint(1)    | NO   | MUL | NULL                |                |\\n| publication_date           | varchar(255)  | NO   |     | NULL                |                |\\n| key_date                   | varchar(10)   | NO   | MUL | NULL                |                |\\n| sort_code                  | int(11)       | NO   | MUL | NULL                |                |\\n| price                      | varchar(255)  | NO   |     | NULL                |                |\\n| page_count                 | decimal(10,3) | YES  |     | NULL                |                |\\n| page_count_uncertain       | tinyint(1)    | NO   |     | 0                   |                |\\n| indicia_frequency          | varchar(255)  | NO   |     |                     |                |\\n| no_indicia_frequency       | tinyint(1)    | NO   | MUL | 0                   |                |\\n| editing                    | longtext      | NO   |     | NULL                |                |\\n| no_editing                 | tinyint(1)    | NO   | MUL | 0                   |                |\\n| notes                      | longtext      | NO   |     | NULL                |                |\\n| created                    | datetime      | NO   |     | 1901-01-01 00:00:00 |                |\\n| modified                   | datetime      | NO   | MUL | 1901-01-01 00:00:00 |                |\\n| deleted                    | tinyint(1)    | NO   | MUL | 0                   |                |\\n| is_indexed                 | tinyint(1)    | NO   | MUL | 0                   |                |\\n| isbn                       | varchar(32)   | NO   | MUL |                     |                |\\n| valid_isbn                 | varchar(13)   | NO   | MUL |                     |                |\\n| no_isbn                    | tinyint(1)    | NO   | MUL | 0                   |                |\\n| variant_of_id              | int(11)       | YES  | MUL | NULL                |                |\\n| variant_name               | varchar(255)  | NO   |     |                     |                |\\n| barcode                    | varchar(38)   | NO   | MUL |                     |                |\\n| no_barcode                 | tinyint(1)    | NO   |     | 0                   |                |\\n| title                      | varchar(255)  | NO   | MUL |                     |                |\\n| no_title                   | tinyint(1)    | NO   | MUL | 0                   |                |\\n| on_sale_date               | varchar(10)   | NO   | MUL | NULL                |                |\\n| on_sale_date_uncertain     | tinyint(1)    | NO   |     | 0                   |                |\\n| rating                     | varchar(255)  | NO   | MUL | NULL                |                |\\n| no_rating                  | tinyint(1)    | NO   | MUL | NULL                |                |\\n| volume_not_printed         | tinyint(1)    | NO   |     | NULL                |                |\\n| no_indicia_printer         | tinyint(1)    | NO   |     | NULL                |                |\\n+----------------------------+---------------+------+-----+---------------------+----------------+\\n40 rows in set (0.00 sec)\\n\\n```\\nGreat, we\'ve got the database up and running!

I figured this would be useful exercise since it would show me what parts of the process could be improved to make it easier.\\n\\nCurrently, the process requires the editor to add ***all*** creators, characters, teams, etc. manually for the reprinted issues associate with the collection, much like a regular issue. One obvious way to simplify this is to automatically ***add*** any characters, team, story titles, etc. for the issues being reprinted. Currently, I\'ve written an [admin action](https://github.com/bpepple/metron/blob/0d6268f92709ef886e49ffe2a134a0b6af3672f7/comicsdb/admin/issue.py#L145) to do this, but sometime in the future I need to expose this functionality so that ***anyone*** adding a Trade Paperback/Collection can save some time.\\n\\nWhen I was creating Metron one of the choices I made was to add creators at an issue-level, and not at a story-level, since I wanted the process for adding an issue to be fairly simple.

Due to the fairly unstructured nature of comic book archives it\'s trivial to tag one with the existing ComicInfo format **and** also a new format. That way users who use applications that only support ComicInfo.xml can still use them, but also gives them the option to use applications that could support the MetronInfo format.\\n\\nMy goals for MetronInfo.xml are:\\n\\n- Fix some of the deficiencies of the ComicInfo format.\\n- Add information to make it easier for Plex-like application to identify data (series, character, etc/) when importing comics into their application.\\n- Document the elements clearly so their use is not ambiguous.\\n\\nCurrently I\'m working right now on finalizing the new format, and would appreciate any help or feedback from the comic book community in this. Feel free to leave suggestions either at the [Discussions Page](https://github.com/Metron-Project/metroninfo/discussions) or contact use over on [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#metrondb:matrix.org).\\n\\nOnce the new format is finalized I plan on writing a tool that will create a MetronInfo.xml file for any existing comic book archive that was tagged with ComicTagger or [Metron-Tagger](https://github.com/Metron-Project/metron-tagger), and also retrieve any missing data from the source of information (Metron or Comic Vine)."},{"id":"welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/welcome","source":"@site/blog/2022-07-06-welcome/index.md","title":"Welcome","description":"Welcome to the Metron Project!
