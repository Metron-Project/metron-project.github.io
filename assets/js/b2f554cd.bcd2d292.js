Anyway, let\'s get started!\\n\\nFirst off, you\'ll want to download the most recent database dump from GCD which can be found [here](https://www.comics.org/download/). Once it\'s finished downloading, unzip the file:\\n\\n```\\nunzip current.zip -d /tmp/\\n```\\nYou should see output similar to this:\\n\\n```\\nArchive:  current.zip\\n  inflating: /tmp/2022-10-01.sql   \\n```\\n\\nOk, now that we\'ve got the data from gcd, let\'s create a [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) container. We need to first pull a MySQL image, which can be done by running:\\n\\n```\\npodman pull docker.io/library/mysql:5.7\\n```\\n\\nAfter it\'s done downloading the image, you can confirm:\\n\\n```\\npodman images\\n```\\n\\nwhich should return output similar to this:\\n\\n```\\nbpepple@frodo ~ $ podman images mysql\\nREPOSITORY               TAG         IMAGE ID      CREATED       SIZE\\ndocker.io/library/mysql  5.7         eb175b0743cc  19 hours ago  448 MB\\n```\\n\\nNow we need to create the container. You\'ll want to replace user and mysql credentials with your own values. The `volume` flag is where on your filesystem you want to save the database. The `Z` suffix is used for systems, primarily [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/linux/what-is-selinux)-based, that use [SELinux](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/linux/what-is-selinux). If you don\'t use SELinux that can be dropped:\\n\\n```\\npodman run -d --name mysql -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_USER=bpepple -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=123456 -e MYSQL_DATABASE=gcd -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=567890 --volume /home/bpepple/Storage/pods/mysql/:/var/lib/mysql:Z mysql:5.7\\n```\\n\\nNow let\'s verify that the container was created and is running by using the following:\\n\\n```\\npodman ps\\n```\\n\\nYou should see output similar to this:\\n\\n```\\nbpepple@frodo ~ $ podman ps\\nCONTAINER ID  IMAGE                       COMMAND CREATED       STATUS           PORTS                  NAMES\\n400c957ae25d  docker.io/library/mysql:5.7 mysqld  7 seconds ago Up 7 seconds ago 0.0.0.0:3306->3306/tcp mysql\\n```\\nNow we just need to dump the data from GCD into the database. We can do this by running:\\n\\n```\\ncat /tmp/2022-10-01.sql | podman exec -i mysql /usr/bin/mysql -u root --password=567890 gcd\\n```\\nDepending on the specs of your machine, this might be a good time to grab some coffee, since the SQL dump is **very** large and will take awhile to finish. Once it\'s done, we can start using the database by attaching to the container:\\n\\n```\\npodman exec -it mysql mysql -ubpepple -p gcd\\n```\\n\\nThis command will prompt you for your password, and then you\'ll see the MySQL prompt where you can run a simple SQL statement like so:\\n```\\n DESCRIBE gcd_issue;\\n```\\nWhich should produce output similar to this:\\n```\\n+----------------------------+---------------+------+-----+---------------------+----------------+\\n| Field                      | Type          | Null | Key | Default             | Extra          |\\n+----------------------------+---------------+------+-----+---------------------+----------------+\\n| id                         | int(11)       | NO   | PRI | NULL                | auto_increment |\\n| number                     | varchar(50)   | NO   | MUL | NULL                |                |\\n| volume                     | varchar(50)   | NO   | MUL |                     |                |\\n| no_volume                  | tinyint(1)    | NO   | MUL | 0                   |                |\\n| display_volume_with_number | tinyint(1)    | NO   | MUL | 0                   |                |\\n| series_id                  | int(11)       | NO   | MUL | NULL                |                |\\n| indicia_publisher_id       | int(11)       | YES  | MUL | NULL                |                |\\n| indicia_pub_not_printed    | tinyint(1)    | NO   |     | NULL                |                |\\n| brand_id                   | int(11)       | YES  | MUL | NULL                |                |\\n| no_brand                   | tinyint(1)    | NO   | MUL | NULL                |                |\\n| publication_date           | varchar(255)  | NO   |     | NULL                |                |\\n| key_date                   | varchar(10)   | NO   | MUL | NULL                |                |\\n| sort_code                  | int(11)       | NO   | MUL | NULL                |                |\\n| price                      | varchar(255)  | NO   |     | NULL                |                |\\n| page_count                 | decimal(10,3) | YES  |     | NULL                |                |\\n| page_count_uncertain       | tinyint(1)    | NO   |     | 0                   |                |\\n| indicia_frequency          | varchar(255)  | NO   |     |                     |                |\\n| no_indicia_frequency       | tinyint(1)    | NO   | MUL | 0                   |                |\\n| editing                    | longtext      | NO   |     | NULL                |                |\\n| no_editing                 | tinyint(1)    | NO   | MUL | 0                   |                |\\n| notes                      | longtext      | NO   |     | NULL                |                |\\n| created                    | datetime      | NO   |     | 1901-01-01 00:00:00 |                |\\n| modified                   | datetime      | NO   | MUL | 1901-01-01 00:00:00 |                |\\n| deleted                    | tinyint(1)    | NO   | MUL | 0                   |                |\\n| is_indexed                 | tinyint(1)    | NO   | MUL | 0                   |                |\\n| isbn                       | varchar(32)   | NO   | MUL |                     |                |\\n| valid_isbn                 | varchar(13)   | NO   | MUL |                     |                |\\n| no_isbn                    | tinyint(1)    | NO   | MUL | 0                   |                |\\n| variant_of_id              | int(11)       | YES  | MUL | NULL                |                |\\n| variant_name               | varchar(255)  | NO   |     |                     |                |\\n| barcode                    | varchar(38)   | NO   | MUL |                     |                |\\n| no_barcode                 | tinyint(1)    | NO   |     | 0                   |                |\\n| title                      | varchar(255)  | NO   | MUL |                     |                |\\n| no_title                   | tinyint(1)    | NO   | MUL | 0                   |                |\\n| on_sale_date               | varchar(10)   | NO   | MUL | NULL                |                |\\n| on_sale_date_uncertain     | tinyint(1)    | NO   |     | 0                   |                |\\n| rating                     | varchar(255)  | NO   | MUL | NULL                |                |\\n| no_rating                  | tinyint(1)    | NO   | MUL | NULL                |                |\\n| volume_not_printed         | tinyint(1)    | NO   |     | NULL                |                |\\n| no_indicia_printer         | tinyint(1)    | NO   |     | NULL                |                |\\n+----------------------------+---------------+------+-----+---------------------+----------------+\\n40 rows in set (0.00 sec)\\n\\n```\\nGreat, we\'ve got the database up and running! To logout from the container just type:\\n\\n```\\n\\\\q\\n```\\n\\nTo stop the container, you would just use the following:\\n\\n```\\npodman stop mysql\\n```\\n\\nAnd that\'s it! Podman has tons of niceties (like auto-updating images, using [systemd](https://systemd.io/) for container start-ups, etc.) and I\'d encourage you to read up on using some its many features. If it get some free time, I\'ll do a follow-up article about using [Python](https://www.python.org/) to query the database and using that data for things like writing metadata to comic archives."},{"id":"ubuntu-2204-lts","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/ubuntu-2204-lts","source":"@site/blog/2022-08-26-ubuntu-22-04/index.md","title":"OS Upgrade","description":"Finally got around to upgrading the OS for Metron to Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS, which overall, was fairly painless.

Due to the fairly unstructured nature of comic book archives it\'s trivial to tag one with the existing ComicInfo format **and** also a new format. That way users who use applications that only support ComicInfo.xml can still use them, but also gives them the option to use applications that could support the MetronInfo format.\\n\\nMy goals for MetronInfo.xml are:\\n\\n- Fix some of the deficiencies of the ComicInfo format.\\n- Add information to make it easier for Plex-like application to identify data (series, character, etc/) when importing comics into their application.\\n- Document the elements clearly so their use is not ambiguous.\\n\\nCurrently I\'m working right now on finalizing the new format, and would appreciate any help or feedback from the comic book community in this. Feel free to leave suggestions either at the [Discussions Page](https://github.com/Metron-Project/metroninfo/discussions) or contact use over on [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#metrondb:matrix.org).\\n\\nOnce the new format is finalized I plan on writing a tool that will create a MetronInfo.xml file for any existing comic book archive that was tagged with ComicTagger or [Metron-Tagger](https://github.com/Metron-Project/metron-tagger), and also retrieve any missing data from the source of information (Metron or Comic Vine)."},{"id":"welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/welcome","source":"@site/blog/2022-07-06-welcome/index.md","title":"Welcome","description":"Welcome to the Metron Project!
