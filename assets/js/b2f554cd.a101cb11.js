I figured this would be useful exercise since it would show me what parts of the process could be improved to make it easier.\\n\\nCurrently, the process requires the editor to add ***all*** creators, characters, teams, etc. manually for the reprinted issues associate with the collection, much like a regular issue. One obvious way to simplify this is to automatically ***add*** any characters, team, story titles, etc. for the issues being reprinted. Currently, I\'ve written an [admin action](https://github.com/bpepple/metron/blob/0d6268f92709ef886e49ffe2a134a0b6af3672f7/comicsdb/admin/issue.py#L145) to do this, but sometime in the future I need to expose this functionality so that ***anyone*** adding a Trade Paperback/Collection can save some time.\\n\\nWhen I was creating Metron one of the choices I made was to add creators at an issue-level, and not at a story-level, since I wanted the process for adding an issue to be fairly simple. The downside to this approach is that adding information to a collection from an issue with multiple stories isn\'t really possible.\ud83d\ude22"},{"id":"50000-issues","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/50000-issues","source":"@site/blog/2022-07-17-50000/index.md","title":"50,000 issues indexed","description":"The Metron Project reached a milestone today by having 50,000 issues added to its database.

Due to the fairly unstructured nature of comic book archives it\'s trivial to tag one with the existing ComicInfo format **and** also a new format. That way users who use applications that only support ComicInfo.xml can still use them, but also gives them the option to use applications that could support the MetronInfo format.\\n\\nMy goals for MetronInfo.xml are:\\n\\n- Fix some of the deficiencies of the ComicInfo format.\\n- Add information to make it easier for Plex-like application to identify data (series, character, etc/) when importing comics into their application.\\n- Document the elements clearly so their use is not ambiguous.\\n\\nCurrently I\'m working right now on finalizing the new format, and would appreciate any help or feedback from the comic book community in this. Feel free to leave suggestions either at the [Discussions Page](https://github.com/Metron-Project/metroninfo/discussions) or contact use over on [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#metrondb:matrix.org).\\n\\nOnce the new format is finalized I plan on writing a tool that will create a MetronInfo.xml file for any existing comic book archive that was tagged with ComicTagger or [Metron-Tagger](https://github.com/Metron-Project/metron-tagger), and also retrieve any missing data from the source of information (Metron or Comic Vine)."},{"id":"welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/welcome","source":"@site/blog/2022-07-06-welcome/index.md","title":"Welcome","description":"Welcome to the Metron Project!
