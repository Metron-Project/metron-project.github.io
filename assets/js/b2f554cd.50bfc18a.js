Here\'s a partial list:\\n\\n- Upgrade Server\\n\\n  Currently, the server is fairly underpowered (1 GiB Memory, 1 CPU, 25 GiB SSD, 1,000 GiB Transfer) but is able to\\n  handle the current load without any particular issues. Based on the current user growth rate, I\'m guessing I\'ll\\n  finally need to upgrade sometime in 2024, I\'m thinking a fairly minor bump should be sufficient (2 GiB Memory,\\n  1CPU, 50 GiB SSD, 2,000 GiB Transfer)\\n\\n- Container Deployment\\n\\n  Before upgrading the server it makes sense to *finally* set up the project to use containers (preferably\\n  [Podman](https://podman.io/)) when deploying the website. If anyone wants to help\\n  with [this](https://github.com/bpepple/metron/issues/69), that would be awesome.\\n\\n- Look into Open Collective for Future Funding\\n\\n  Eventually it will make sense to look at setting up something like\\n  [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/opensource) to help with future server costs. Right now the server costs\\n  around $14 a month (not including annual domain name & email hosting costs) so it\'s not really an issue, but down the\\n  road I probably won\'t want to cover all the costs of the project myself.\\n\\n  Glancing at the criteria needed for acceptance to the Open Source Collective, it looks like Metron meets most of them,\\n  except having *100 stars* on [Github](https://github.com/). ***So, if you\'d like to help the project, one easy\\n  way would be to star the [repository](https://github.com/bpepple/metron).***\\n\\n- Manga / International Support\\n\\n  It would be nice to make a final decision on whether to support Manga and Non-U.S. issues, right now I\'m inclined not\\n  to but *if* we do add support it will necessitate some changes to the database for things like currencies, languages,\\n  and such.\\n\\nI\'m sure there will be other smaller items (like tweaking the site\'s css and such), but these are most items I\'ll be\\nlooking at in 2024. \ud83c\udf89"},{"id":"october-2023-update","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/october-2023-update","source":"@site/blog/2023-10-29-october-update/index.md","title":"October 2023 Update","description":"New Indexed Issues Milestone","date":"2023-10-29T10:04:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 29, 2023","tags":[{"label":"comic","permalink":"/blog/tags/comic"},{"label":"database","permalink":"/blog/tags/database"},{"label":"metron","permalink":"/blog/tags/metron"},{"label":"metrontagger","permalink":"/blog/tags/metrontagger"},{"label":"comictagger","permalink":"/blog/tags/comictagger"}],"readingTime":1.6,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Brian Pepple","title":"Founder of the Metron Project / Code Monkey","url":"https://github.com/bpepple","imageURL":"https://github.com/bpepple.png","key":"bpepple"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"october-2023-update","title":"October 2023 Update","date":"2023-10-29T10:04","authors":["bpepple"],"tags":["comic","database","metron","metrontagger","comictagger"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"November 2023 Update","permalink":"/blog/november-2023-update"},"nextItem":{"title":"Latest Happenings","permalink":"/blog/latest-happenings"}},"content":"## New Indexed Issues Milestone\\n\\nThe [Metron Project](https://metron.cloud/) reached a milestone this month by having more than 77,000 issues added to\\nits database.

The feature will get the hashes for\\nall the pages of the comics in a directory, and then ask the user if the image should be removed from the comics. This\\nis done by using the user\'s system image viewer to display the duplicate image. Once the user has reviewed all the\\nduplicated images it will ask the user whether to write the changes to the comics and then prompt them if they also want\\nto update the [ComicInfo.xml](https://anansi-project.github.io/docs/comicinfo/intro) (if it exists) for the page\\nchanges.\\n\\nThis feature most likely will work best when running on a weekly basis, instead of on a ***whole*** comic collection,\\nsince it\'s asking the user to review all the duplicate images *before* writing the changes. I\'m planning on reworking\\nthis to make it more feasible to use on a large comic collection, but that is pretty far down on my TODO list (but if\\nsomeone wants to work on this I\'m more than willing to review a Pull Request).\\n\\n**Note**: I\'ve been using this for the last month and haven\'t had any issues, but if you plan on using this I would\\nsuggest backing up any files when using this initially, and verifying it works correctly for you since once the changes\\nare written they can\'t be undone! \ud83d\udca3\\n\\n### Miscellaneous Maintenance\\n\\nThe rest of v1.6.4 changes are primarily developer-side changes updating the toolsets for Metron-Tagger.\\n\\n## Comic-Tagger\\n\\n[Comic-Tagger](https://github.com/comictagger/comictagger) recently released\\ntheir [Metron-Talker](https://github.com/comictagger/metron_talker) plugin which adds support for tagging any comic with\\nmetadata from [Metron](https://metron.cloud/)."},{"id":"latest-happenings","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/latest-happenings","source":"@site/blog/2023-05-23-latest-happenings/index.md","title":"Latest Happenings","description":"New Indexed Issues Milestone","date":"2023-05-24T13:24:00.000Z","formattedDate":"May 24, 2023","tags":[{"label":"comic","permalink":"/blog/tags/comic"},{"label":"database","permalink":"/blog/tags/database"},{"label":"series","permalink":"/blog/tags/series"},{"label":"api","permalink":"/blog/tags/api"},{"label":"comicvine","permalink":"/blog/tags/comicvine"},{"label":"comictagger","permalink":"/blog/tags/comictagger"}],"readingTime":0.88,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Brian Pepple","title":"Founder of the Metron Project / Code Monkey","url":"https://github.com/bpepple","imageURL":"https://github.com/bpepple.png","key":"bpepple"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"latest-happenings","title":"Latest Happenings","date":"2023-05-24T13:24","authors":["bpepple"],"tags":["comic","database","series","api","comicvine","comictagger"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"October 2023 Update","permalink":"/blog/october-2023-update"},"nextItem":{"title":"Limited Series Type","permalink":"/blog/series-type-change"}},"content":"## New Indexed Issues Milestone\\n\\nThe [Metron Project](https://metron.cloud/) reached a milestone today by having 65,000 issues added to its database.

Anyway, let\'s get started!\\n\\nFirst off, you\'ll want to download the most recent database dump from GCD which can be found [here](https://www.comics.org/download/). Once it\'s finished downloading, unzip the file:\\n\\n```\\nunzip current.zip -d /tmp/\\n```\\nYou should see output similar to this:\\n\\n```\\nArchive:  current.zip\\n  inflating: /tmp/2022-10-01.sql   \\n```\\n\\nOk, now that we\'ve got the data from gcd, let\'s create a [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) container. We need to first pull a MySQL image, which can be done by running:\\n\\n```\\npodman pull docker.io/library/mysql:5.7\\n```\\n\\nAfter it\'s done downloading the image, you can confirm:\\n\\n```\\npodman images\\n```\\n\\nwhich should return output similar to this:\\n\\n```\\nbpepple@frodo ~ $ podman images mysql\\nREPOSITORY               TAG         IMAGE ID      CREATED       SIZE\\ndocker.io/library/mysql  5.7         eb175b0743cc  19 hours ago  448 MB\\n```\\n\\nNow we need to create the container. You\'ll want to replace user and mysql credentials with your own values. The `volume` flag is where on your filesystem you want to save the database. The `Z` suffix is used for systems, primarily [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/linux/what-is-selinux)-based, that use [SELinux](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/linux/what-is-selinux). If you don\'t use SELinux that can be dropped:\\n\\n```\\npodman run -d --name mysql -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_USER=bpepple -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=123456 -e MYSQL_DATABASE=gcd -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=567890 --volume /home/bpepple/Storage/pods/mysql/:/var/lib/mysql:Z mysql:5.7\\n```\\n\\nNow let\'s verify that the container was created and is running by using the following:\\n\\n```\\npodman ps\\n```\\n\\nYou should see output similar to this:\\n\\n```\\nbpepple@frodo ~ $ podman ps\\nCONTAINER ID  IMAGE                       COMMAND CREATED       STATUS           PORTS                  NAMES\\n400c957ae25d  docker.io/library/mysql:5.7 mysqld  7 seconds ago Up 7 seconds ago 0.0.0.0:3306->3306/tcp mysql\\n```\\nNow we just need to dump the data from GCD into the database. We can do this by running:\\n\\n```\\ncat /tmp/2022-10-01.sql | podman exec -i mysql /usr/bin/mysql -u root --password=567890 gcd\\n```\\nDepending on the specs of your machine, this might be a good time to grab some coffee, since the SQL dump is **very** large and will take awhile to finish. Once it\'s done, we can start using the database by attaching to the container:\\n\\n```\\npodman exec -it mysql mysql -ubpepple -p gcd\\n```\\n\\nThis command will prompt you for your password, and then you\'ll see the MySQL prompt where you can run a simple SQL statement like so:\\n```\\n DESCRIBE gcd_issue;\\n```\\nWhich should produce output similar to this:\\n```\\n+----------------------------+---------------+------+-----+---------------------+----------------+\\n| Field                      | Type          | Null | Key | Default             | Extra          |\\n+----------------------------+---------------+------+-----+---------------------+----------------+\\n| id                         | int(11)       | NO   | PRI | NULL                | auto_increment |\\n| number                     | varchar(50)   | NO   | MUL | NULL                |                |\\n| volume                     | varchar(50)   | NO   | MUL |                     |                |\\n| no_volume                  | tinyint(1)    | NO   | MUL | 0                   |                |\\n| display_volume_with_number | tinyint(1)    | NO   | MUL | 0                   |                |\\n| series_id                  | int(11)       | NO   | MUL | NULL                |                |\\n| indicia_publisher_id       | int(11)       | YES  | MUL | NULL                |                |\\n| indicia_pub_not_printed    | tinyint(1)    | NO   |     | NULL                |                |\\n| brand_id                   | int(11)       | YES  | MUL | NULL                |                |\\n| no_brand                   | tinyint(1)    | NO   | MUL | NULL                |                |\\n| publication_date           | varchar(255)  | NO   |     | NULL                |                |\\n| key_date                   | varchar(10)   | NO   | MUL | NULL                |                |\\n| sort_code                  | int(11)       | NO   | MUL | NULL                |                |\\n| price                      | varchar(255)  | NO   |     | NULL                |                |\\n| page_count                 | decimal(10,3) | YES  |     | NULL                |                |\\n| page_count_uncertain       | tinyint(1)    | NO   |     | 0                   |                |\\n| indicia_frequency          | varchar(255)  | NO   |     |                     |                |\\n| no_indicia_frequency       | tinyint(1)    | NO   | MUL | 0                   |                |\\n| editing                    | longtext      | NO   |     | NULL                |                |\\n| no_editing                 | tinyint(1)    | NO   | MUL | 0                   |                |\\n| notes                      | longtext      | NO   |     | NULL                |                |\\n| created                    | datetime      | NO   |     | 1901-01-01 00:00:00 |                |\\n| modified                   | datetime      | NO   | MUL | 1901-01-01 00:00:00 |                |\\n| deleted                    | tinyint(1)    | NO   | MUL | 0                   |                |\\n| is_indexed                 | tinyint(1)    | NO   | MUL | 0                   |                |\\n| isbn                       | varchar(32)   | NO   | MUL |                     |                |\\n| valid_isbn                 | varchar(13)   | NO   | MUL |                     |                |\\n| no_isbn                    | tinyint(1)    | NO   | MUL | 0                   |                |\\n| variant_of_id              | int(11)       | YES  | MUL | NULL                |                |\\n| variant_name               | varchar(255)  | NO   |     |                     |                |\\n| barcode                    | varchar(38)   | NO   | MUL |                     |                |\\n| no_barcode                 | tinyint(1)    | NO   |     | 0                   |                |\\n| title                      | varchar(255)  | NO   | MUL |                     |                |\\n| no_title                   | tinyint(1)    | NO   | MUL | 0                   |                |\\n| on_sale_date               | varchar(10)   | NO   | MUL | NULL                |                |\\n| on_sale_date_uncertain     | tinyint(1)    | NO   |     | 0                   |                |\\n| rating                     | varchar(255)  | NO   | MUL | NULL                |                |\\n| no_rating                  | tinyint(1)    | NO   | MUL | NULL                |                |\\n| volume_not_printed         | tinyint(1)    | NO   |     | NULL                |                |\\n| no_indicia_printer         | tinyint(1)    | NO   |     | NULL                |                |\\n+----------------------------+---------------+------+-----+---------------------+----------------+\\n40 rows in set (0.00 sec)\\n\\n```\\nGreat, we\'ve got the database up and running!

I figured this would be useful exercise since it would show me what parts of the process could be improved to make it easier.\\n\\nCurrently, the process requires the editor to add ***all*** creators, characters, teams, etc. manually for the reprinted issues associate with the collection, much like a regular issue. One obvious way to simplify this is to automatically ***add*** any characters, team, story titles, etc. for the issues being reprinted. Currently, I\'ve written an [admin action](https://github.com/bpepple/metron/blob/0d6268f92709ef886e49ffe2a134a0b6af3672f7/comicsdb/admin/issue.py#L145) to do this, but sometime in the future I need to expose this functionality so that ***anyone*** adding a Trade Paperback/Collection can save some time.\\n\\nWhen I was creating Metron one of the choices I made was to add creators at an issue-level, and not at a story-level, since I wanted the process for adding an issue to be fairly simple.

Due to the fairly unstructured nature of comic book archives it\'s trivial to tag one with the existing ComicInfo format **and** also a new format. That way users who use applications that only support ComicInfo.xml can still use them, but also gives them the option to use applications that could support the MetronInfo format.\\n\\nMy goals for MetronInfo.xml are:\\n\\n- Fix some of the deficiencies of the ComicInfo format.\\n- Add information to make it easier for Plex-like application to identify data (series, character, etc/) when importing comics into their application.\\n- Document the elements clearly so their use is not ambiguous.\\n\\nCurrently I\'m working right now on finalizing the new format, and would appreciate any help or feedback from the comic book community in this. Feel free to leave suggestions either at the [Discussions Page](https://github.com/Metron-Project/metroninfo/discussions) or contact use over on [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#metrondb:matrix.org).\\n\\nOnce the new format is finalized I plan on writing a tool that will create a MetronInfo.xml file for any existing comic book archive that was tagged with ComicTagger or [Metron-Tagger](https://github.com/Metron-Project/metron-tagger), and also retrieve any missing data from the source of information (Metron or Comic Vine)."},{"id":"welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/welcome","source":"@site/blog/2022-07-06-welcome/index.md","title":"Welcome","description":"Welcome to the Metron Project!
